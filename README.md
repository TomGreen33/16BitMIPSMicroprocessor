This repository contains my group's submissions for the final project of our Computer Organization and Design class (ENGG 3380),
which I took during the second semester of my second year. We were tasked with designing a microprocessor and implementing it on 
an FPGA board. The final implementation had to show that the design was capable of counting the fibonacci sequence up to a certain amount. 
The project was split into 3 phases, of which, the first 2 have been uploaded. The final design contained an ALU, which could be decomposed into
an arithmetic unit, logic unit, conditional unit, and a "master" multiplexer. The design also contained control unit, which was composed of
a Microprogram address decoder, 8-bit ripple carry adder, 3-1 MUX, microcode store, and micro PC. We were also responsible with populating 
the microcode store so that the final design could work correctly.

This is the work Elijah Johnston, Lorentâ€¯Aliu and I. I strongly discourage any form of plagarism from this project. I have uploaded my work to github to showcase my work 
to potential employers.
